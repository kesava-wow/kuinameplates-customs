Kui_Nameplates_Customs
======================
Templates and scripts to modify KNP's behaviour, generally made for specific people, for testing ideas, or if I'm just too lazy to put something in KNP by default.

KNP's updates might cause these to spew errors at you. You need to manually update them; bookmark this page!

How do I use this?
------------------

1. Download [Kui_Nameplates_Custom.zip](https://github.com/kesava-wow/kuinameplates-customs/raw/master/Kui_Nameplates_Custom.zip) and install it like any other addon.
    - By extracting the `Kui_Nameplates_Custom` folder into `World of Warcraft/_retail_/Interface/AddOns`
2. Click one of the custom.\*.lua files in the list above ("Save as" will NOT work for this link)
    - If you end up on a [page like this](https://github.com/kesava-wow/kuinameplates-customs/raw/master/virus-example.png), you can just save the page (CTRL+S).
    - If you end up on a GitHub webpage, [find this button](https://github.com/kesava-wow/kuinameplates-customs/raw/master/this-is-the-raw-link.png), right click it, and hit "Save as..." (or whatever equivalent there is in your browser).
3. Save the file within the `Kui_Nameplates_Custom` folder you just extracted
4. Rename the file to custom.lua (overwriting the old file if necessary)
5. Launch the game and make sure Kui_Nameplates_Custom shows in the addon list and is enabled

To use more than one at a time:
---

1. Download just lua file you want into the `Interface/AddOns/Kui_Nameplates_Custom` folder you already created.
2. Open the `Kui_Nameplates_Custom.toc` file with a plaintext editor (like notepad).
3. Add the name of the new lua file to the end of the toc file, on its own line, after the `custom.lua` line.
4. Relaunch WoW.
